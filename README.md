# Mod Descriptions

This resource pack adds additional unique descriptions to modded blocks, items, and entities. It is an add-on for [Item Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-descriptions).

## Supported Mods

- [Wraith Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones)
- [Infinite Dimensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/infinite-dimensions)
- [Beans Backpacks](https://modrinth.com/mod/beans-backpacks)

## Adding New Desccriptions

The base mod provides descriptions for vanilla blocks, items, and entities - including supported April Fools versions. This resource pack stores each mod's translations in the same namespace as the mod, to aid in modularity.

```json
"lore.<namespace>.<your_item_here>": "A mysterious modded block."
```

For more information on formatting, see the information on the [Item Descriptions Wiki](https://github.com/cassiancc/Item-Descriptions/wiki).
