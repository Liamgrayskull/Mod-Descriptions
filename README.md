## Adding New Desccriptions

The base mod provides descriptions for vanilla blocks, items, and entities - including supported April Fools versions. This resource pack stores each mod's translations in the same namespace as the mod, to aid in modularity.

```json
"lore.<namespace>.<your_item_here>": "A mysterious modded block."
```

For more information on formatting and recommendations on how to write a description, see the information on the [Item Descriptions Wiki](https://moddedmc.wiki/en/project/item-descriptions/docs/Writing-Descriptions).
